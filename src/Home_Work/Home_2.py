# Task 3

# = -> is a assignment operator, ==is a comparison operator.
# ** is used for power, it can be use like (2 ** 3 ) o/p =8 , 2*2*2
# ^ is a XOR operator,(X^Y)

### Task #4
# - Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula ``` area=Ï€Ã—r^2``` ( Take pie as 3.14)

# radius=float(input("Enter the radius\n"))
# print(radius)
# radius=math.pi*math.pow(radius,2)
# print("Radius= ",radius)

### Task #5
# - Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

num1 = input("Enter the number1\n")
num2 = input("Enter the number2\n")
print(num1 > num2)
print(num1 < num2)
print(num1 == num2)
